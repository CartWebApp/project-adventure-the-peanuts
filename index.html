  <h2>Chapter 1: Seven Days of Creation</h2>
  <!-- Fade out from black^ then smooths to the next scene -->
    <p>The choir sings the praise of the Holy Lord, the crowd with joyous and beaming faces
      at the sight of the young choir who stand on the stage. You stand amongst the fellow choir members; your voice trembling along with their confidence.
      You had just joined not too long ago, your voice hadn't well adjusted yet to complex singing and language.</p>
  <!-- Paragraph transition smoothly -->
    <p>But despite your crude performance, you managed to keep the faces of the listeners happy.</p>
  <!-- Paragraph transition smoothly with a button being added in-->
    <button class="Continue" onclick="transitionToScene2()">Continue</button>
</div>

<div id="scene2" style="display: none;">
  <p>The sunlight dims as the night begans to inch closer to your lovely city. You watch as people go through the chapel's doors
    to head home before anything icky can occur during a nightly return. You find yourself standing, amongst your fellow peers who
  rid themselves of their white robes and neatly folded it back lovingly back to the closet.</p>
  <!-- Paragraph transition smoothly -->
  <p>"Hey (name) get home safely!" Your peer says to you with their uptmost sincerity before heading out the doors like the rest.</p>
  <button class="Choice" onclick="transitionToScene3A()">"I will, thanks for your concern! You too!"</button>
  <button class="Choice" onclick="transitionToScene3B()">"Don't worry about me."</button>
  <button class="Choice" onclick="transitionToScene3C()">"..."</button>
</div>

<div id="scene3A" style="display:none;">
  <p>Your peer smiles at your concern and response, before giving you a wave and heading off into the night. You felt a slight enlated sense of happiness.</p>
  <button class="Continue" onclick="transitionToScene4()">Continue</button>
</div>
<div id="scene3B" style="display:none;">
  <p>Your peer looks at you with a bit of a strained smile before nodding, and heading off into the night. You felt slight dip in your mood, you felt annoyed.</p>
  <button class="Continue" onclick="transitionToScene4()">Continue</button>
</div>
<div id="scene3C" style="display:none;">
  <p>Your peer stares at you as their smile drops; giving one last wave and a 'goodbye' before heading off into the night. You felt a sense of guilt in you, you feel uncomfortable.</p>
  <button class="Continue" onclick="transitionToScene4()">Continue</button>
</div>

<div id="scene4" style="display: none;">
  <p>You waited until everyone was gone to do your duties. As much as you were a newcomer, you had a job and that was small things like be the one to clean up the choir room before leaving.
    It was to instil a sense of "duty" in your place of the hierachy; as of now? Bottomfeeder.
  </p>
  <!-- Paragraph transition smoothly -->
   <p>You estimated that it took you at least one quarter of the moon's cycle to finish cleaning up. As much as the choir members were good, you knew there were a few individuals who were...a bit laxed
    on the rules of the Holy Church. 'Nevermind them,' you thought, 'At least the place looks sparkling clean.'
   </p>
   <!-- Paragraph transition smoothly -->
   <p>Afterwards, you trailed down the corridors that reaked of incense and old holy water, and the carpets beneath your feet that itched</p>
